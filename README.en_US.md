# Run For Money

[Go to Chinese Version](https://github.com/SNWCreations/RunForMoney/blob/main/README.md) [English version now]

This plugin is my second work. It was made after watching the Minecraft version of the series "Run For Money" by @骑单车の茂茂 (https://space.bilibili.com/8957291).

## This plugin's functions & features

* Basic squad
* Administrators can control the game flow
* ~~There is a simple event mechanism, which can be monitored in the snw.rfm.api.events package.~~ **The API content is now split. See [RFM API](https://github.com/SNWCreations/RunForMoneyAPI).**
* Strong configurability, the configuration file has detailed comments for easy understanding.
* Hunter grouping, suitable for certain tasks where hunters will be released if they fail, they can be released individually or in groups.
* Rich commands, friendly to administrators.
* Game data query is convenient.

To view the commands of this plugin, please go to the [COMMANDS.md](https://github.com/SNWCreations/RunForMoney/blob/main/COMMANDS.md) file.

### **Notice:**
* Minecraft version supported by this plugin: **1.16.X** , the author has tested 1.16.5 , in theory all sub-versions of 1.16 can be used.
* The task needs to be implemented by itself.
* ~~**When using this plugin, you need to rename the map used in the game to 'world' (without single brackets).**~~ No longer required since v1.8.0, but not supplying a proper world name will cause the inter-terminator position to not be defined.
* When using this plugin, you need to set the "allow-flight" of the server configuration to true .
* **The /reload command cannot be used, otherwise all existing game data will be lost.**
* If you want to repeat the game in a map, please pay attention to record the content of the Coin List! Because when starting a new game, the data of the B currency list will be cleared!
